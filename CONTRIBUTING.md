# Contriubuting Guidelines

# Versioning
This repository follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) which is implemented via CI. Versioning happens automatically upon every commit in `master`.

# Style Guide

All pull requests SHOULD adhere to the [Conventional Commits](https://conventionalcommits.org/) specification.

The commit contains the following structural elements, to communicate intent to the consumers of your library:

* fix: a commit of the type fix patches a bug in your codebase (this correlates with PATCH in semantic versioning).
* feat: a commit of the type feat introduces a new feature to the codebase (this correlates with MINOR in semantic versioning).
* BREAKING CHANGE: a commit that has a footer BREAKING CHANGE:, or appends a ! after the type/scope, introduces a breaking API change (correlating with MAJOR in semantic versioning). A BREAKING CHANGE can be part of commits of any type.
* types other than `fix:` and `feat:` are allowed, for example `build:`, `chore:`, `ci:`, `docs:`, `style:`, `refactor:`, `perf:`, `test:`, and others.
* footers other than BREAKING CHANGE: <description> may be provided and follow a convention similar to git trailer format.

Additional types are not mandated by the Conventional Commits specification, and have no implicit effect in semantic versioning (unless they include a BREAKING CHANGE). 

A scope may be provided to a commitâ€™s type, to provide additional contextual information and is contained within parenthesis, e.g., feat(parser): add ability to parse arrays.
