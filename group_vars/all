# Check if local Git Repository is on branch MASTER and up-to-date
# If not, stop playbook execution
# This is an additional security measure to ensure no untested infrastructure code
# is deployed from development to production
# If "true", Ansible only executes its tasks when on branch Master and everything is up-to-date
# If "false", nothing will stop you from messing up the entire infrastructure with development code ;)

# ATTENTION: Don't simply exchange the key
