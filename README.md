**apollo** is highly scalable (you can start with 1 node and scale up infinitely) and comes with a shared storage layer so you don't have to think about data persistance too much. Your applications' data is available within your entire cluster and regularly backed up - automagically (**Docker Swarm only**).

**apollo** comes with a pre-configured set of apps that integrate with each other - such as **GitLab, Sentry, Prometheus, Grafana, Loki, a user backend** and more. You simply enable them and start working!

**apollo** is tailored to development teams. Made by seasoned operators, it contains everything a DevOps-enabled team needs to start changing the world.

**apollo** runs on every major and minor cloud provider, as well as directly on bare-metal, embedded devices or platforms like Proxmox and VMWare. **apollo** comes with integrated support for an [inital set of infrastructure providers](modules/).

**apollo** follows an **Infrastructure as Code** design-pattern. The cluster, its state and the apps running on the platform are merely a function applied to the data stored in **apollo**'s storage layer. **apollo** strictly separates data from application, which means that migrating between clusters is as easy as restoring a backup to a new cluster. Moving a cluster is as easy as providing new compute-resources at a different provider.

**apollo** creates and manages so called **spaces** - clusters of machines with a specific configuration and purpose.

**apollo** is based on the latest technologies and design patterns. It strives to be fully automated and it greatly reduces the operational overhead in organizations. It's a DevOps platform, doing lots of the ops work automagically for you. You can use it to bootstrap and manage your Kubernetes cluster.

## Getting started

The simplest way to use **apollo** is to run our [Docker Image](https://hub.docker.com/r/wearep3r/apollo/tags).

### Prerequisites

You need to install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/). Once done, create a directory that holds apollo's configuration and the [spaces](#-) apollo manages:

```bash
mkdir -p $HOME/.apollo
```

### Installing apollo

Download apollo's Docker Image from the Docker Hub:

```bash
docker pull wearep3r/apollo
```

### Running apollo

Run apollo's Docker Image (**apollo** needs access to a few local directories to work):

```bash
docker run --rm -it \
  --name apollo \
  -v ${HOME}/.ssh:/root/.ssh \
  -v ${HOME}/.gitconfig:/root/.gitconfig \
  -v ${HOME}/.apollo:/root/.apollo \
  wearep3r/apollo:latest
```

**PRO TIP**: Save this **alias** to your `.zshrc` or `.bashrc` file to get quick access to **apollo**:

```bash
alias apollo="mkdir -p $HOME/.apollo; docker run --rm -it --name apollo -v ${HOME}/.ssh:/root/.ssh -v ${HOME}/.gitconfig:/root/.gitconfig -v ${HOME}/.apollo:/root/.apollo wearep3r/apollo:latest"
```

### Create your first space

Open a new terminal and run `apollo`. You will be presented with a prompt from inside the **apollo** Container:

```bash
üöÄ .spaces
```

You're inside your **spaces directory** (aka `APOLLO_SPACES_DIR`). From here you can create a new **space** by simply running `init`.

You will be guided through the creation of a new space.

1. Give your **space** a name (**hint**: use a `hostname` formatted name (e.g. `apollo-demo-1`) as it will be used in the **space** urls)
2. If you want to sync your space with a remote git repository, type `y`, otherwise just press enter
3. If you want to use one of apollo's supported cloud providers, enter the tag here, otherwise just press enter (**hint**: you will be asked for credentials if you choose a cloud provider)
4. Enter the ip-addresses of the nodes you want to be a manager in your apollo cluster (**hint**: enter multiple ips comma-separated, e.g. `192.168.178.187,192.168.178.188`)
5. Enter the ip-addresses of the nodes you want to be a worker in your apollo cluster (**hint**: enter multiple ips comma-separated, e.g. `192.168.178.197,192.168.178.198`)
6. Enter your desired base-domain (e.g. `mydomain.com` - your apollo cluster will run on `apollo-demo-1.mydomain.com`) if you have one, otherwise just press enter (we use **xip.io** wildcard DNS to provide a useful url for your apollo cluster out-of-the-box: `apollo-demo-1.192.168.178.187.xip.io`)
7. If you want to use LetsEncrypt, type `y`, otherwise just press enter (**hint**: LetsEncrypt doesn't work without a public IP for your apollo cluster and you need to provide an e-mail address if you want to use LetsEncrypt)

```bash
[DEV] üöÄ .spaces init
[apollo] Initializing new Space
[apollo] Name: apollo-demo-1
[apollo-demo-1] Do you want to sync this Space with a remote repository? [y/N]
[apollo-demo-1] Cloud Provider (generic,hcloud,digitalocean,aws):
[apollo-demo-1] Manager IPs (comma separated): 192.168.178.187

```

**Congratulations!** You just created your first **apollo** space. You've been taken to your space directory (aka `APOLLO_SPACE_DIR`) automatically and can now take a look at your **space** config:

```bash
[DEV] üöÄ apollo-demo-1.space ls
.ssh
apollo.env
infrastructure.apollo.env
```

If you're using a cloud provider, certain necessary values **apollo** needs to operate will be automatically saved to `nodes.apolloenv` - amongst them `APOLLO_INGRESS_IP`. **apollo** generates SSH-Keys for you in `$APOLLO_SPACE_DIR/.ssh` which will be used to connect to the provisioned infrastructure.

In case you're using your own infrastructure, please add the following values (adjusted to your infrastructure) to `infrastructure.apollo.env` manually before proceeding.

```bash
APOLLO_INGRESS_IP=1.2.3.4
APOLLO_NODES_MANAGER=1.2.3.4
APOLLO_NODES_WORKER=
APOLLO_PRIVATE_INTERFACE=eth0
APOLLO_PROVIDER=generic
APOLLO_PUBLIC_INTERFACE=eth0
```

### Deploy a space

Using `deploy`, you can deploy your Ssace. Please note that for a successful deployment `APOLLO_INGRESS_IP` needs to have a useful value and needs to be accessible through SSH with the SSH-Keys generated during the init process.

```bash
üöÄ apollo-demo-1.space deploy
```

## Advanced usage

### Architecture

**apollo** is organized in **Spaces**. Such a **Space** works as a private environment with a specific configuration and size (it's kind of a **Virtual Private Cloud**). A **Space** is designed to be ephemeral but offers strong capabilities for stateful workloads and long-living clusters.

You can [use GitLab to store and collaborate on **Spaces**](manage-spaces.md).

### Configuration

**apollo** is a PaaS toolkit and comes with a bundled IaaS component. The following outlines typical **Space** configurations. For more advanced use-cases, see [Advanced Configuration](advanced-configuration.md).

#### Default configuration

For the following, we assume to handle a **Space** called `apollo-demo`. A Space has sane defaults so it can be started with minimum configuration.

Each Space has a so called `INGRESS_IP` which refers to the node (a VM/Server in the cluster) handling all incoming traffic. Thus, the `INGRESS_IP` will be used for all things DNS and more. It's a vital part of how **apollo** works and defaults to `127.0.0.1` or the IP address of the first manager node.

```bash
APOLLO_SPACE=apollo-demo
APOLLO_CONFIG_DIR=~/.apollo
APOLLO_SPACES_DIR=$APOLLO_CONFIG_DIR/.spaces
APOLLO_SPACE_DIR=$APOLLO_SPACES_DIR/$APOLLO_SPACE
APOLLO_PROVIDER=generic
APOLLO_INGRESS_IP=127.0.0.1
APOLLO_BASE_DOMAIN=$APOLLO_INGRESS_IP.xip.io
```

**References**:

- `xip.io`: [wildcard DNS](http://xip.io/)

#### IaaS

Typically, IaaS is confgured in a file called `infrastructure.apolloenv` living in `$APOLLO_SPACE_DIR` (which defaults to `$APOLLO_SPACES_DIR/$APOLLO_SPACE` in the `apollo` container).

The **minimum viable config** to spin up IaaS would be:

```bash
APOLLO_PROVIDER=[hcloud|aws|digitalocean]
PROVIDER_API_KEY=
```

Where `PROVIDER_API_KEY` is actually `HCLOUD_TOKEN` or something similar, depending on your provider.

This would spin up **1 small Ubuntu 18.04 VM** at your cloud provider of choice. It will add 3 files to your **Space**:

- `infrastructure.apollo.plan` is a [Terraform Planfile](https://www.terraform.io/docs/commands/plan.html)
- `infrastructure.apollo.tfstate` is a [Terraform Statefile](https://www.terraform.io/docs/state/index.html)
- `nodes.apolloenv` contains configuration necessary for Apollo to deploy the PaaS component to the VM

#### PaaS

**apollo** reads its configuration from the **Environment**. It's designed to run in a container and export configuration found in the **Space** directory to the container's environment. This includes the aforementioned `nodes.apolloenv` that only exists if IaaS has been provisioned successfully or if you created it manually with information about your own hosts.

Assuming we use IaaS to provide infrastructure, the **minimum viable config** to deploy a platform with **apollo** would be:

```bash
APOLLO_SPACE=$SPACE_NAME
```

**ATTENTION**: You need to replace `$SPACE_NAME` with the name of the VPC this Apollo-Deployment is part of. It's the name you picked during `init`.

This configuration would deploy the platform with a `$APOLLO_BASE_DOMAIN` of `$APOLLO_INGRESS_IP.xip.io` (`$APOLLO_INGRESS_IP` will be deducted from the Terraform output), Docker Swarm as orchestrator and a few backend services (see [Backplane](backplane.md)). Assuming `APOLLO_INGRESS_IP=213.45.74.3` and `APOLLO_ENVIRONMENT=apollo-demo`, you would have access to the following services:

- Portainer: [http://portainer.apollo-demo.213.45.74.3.xip.io](http://portainer.apollo-demo.213.45.74.3.xip.io)
- Traefik: [http://proxy.apollo-demo.213.45.74.3.xip.io](http://proxy.apollo-demo.213.45.74.3.xip.io)
- Prometheus: [http://prometheus.apollo-demo.213.45.74.3.xip.io](http://prometheus.apollo-demo.213.45.74.3.xip.io)
- Grafana: [http://grafana.apollo-demo.213.45.74.3.xip.io](http://grafana.apollo-demo.213.45.74.3.xip.io)

Username is `admin` and password is `insecure!`.

**Pro-Tipp**: if you want to use your own domain - `beingyou.rocks` - add the following records to your DNS and set `APOLLO_BASE_DOMAIN=beingyou.rocks` in `apolloenv`:

```bash
@ apollo-demo.beingyou.rocks 213.45.74.3
* apollo-demo.beingyou.rocks 213.45.74.3
```

This would give you access to the following endpoints automagically:

- Portainer: [http://portainer.apollo-demo.beingyou.rocks](http://portainer.apollo-demo.beingyou.rocks)
- Traefik: [http://proxy.apollo-demo.beingyou.rocks](http://proxy.apollo-demo.beingyou.rocks)
- Prometheus: [http://prometheus.apollo-demo.beingyou.rocks](http://prometheus.apollo-demo.beingyou.rocks)
- Grafana: [http://grafana.apollo-demo.beingyou.rocks](http://grafana.apollo-demo.beingyou.rocks)
