# The namespace where all CSI resources should be installed:
hcloud_namespace: "kube-system"

# The playbook installes a few resources like:
# Secret, StorageClass, ServiceAccount, ClusterRole,
# ClusterRoleBinding, StatefulSet and DaemonSet
# All this resources have names and the names will be prefixed
# with the prefix defined here:
hcloud_resource_prefix: "hcloud"

# Make {{ hcloud_resource_prefix }}-volumes the default
# storageClass. If you only have this storageClass then
# just set it to "true". If you've other storageClass'es
# already then "false" might be your choise.
hcloud_is_default_class: "true"

# The "volumeBindingMode" field controls when volume binding and
# dynamic provisioning should occur. The default value is "Immediate".
# The "Immediate" mode indicates that volume binding and dynamic
# provisioning occurs once the "PersistentVolumeClaim" is created.
# The "WaitForFirstConsumer" mode which will delay the binding and
# provisioning of a "PersistentVolume" until a Pod using the
# "PersistentVolumeClaim" is created. "PersistentVolumes" will be
# selected or provisioned conforming to the topology that is specified
# by the Podâ€™s scheduling constraints. These include, but are not
# limited to, resource requirements, node selectors, pod affinity
# and anti-affinity, and taints and tolerations.
